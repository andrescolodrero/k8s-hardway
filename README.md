# k8s-hardway
Just learning the hard way... on Azure.

The intention is to create a K8S cluster from scratch, running commands manually to understand the whole deployments.

# Steps
1. Provision VMs 
  Machines are provisioned on Azure, all of them in same resource group and VNET
  


3. Install CFSSL and KUBECTL
4. Create CA and certs
